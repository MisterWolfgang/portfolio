## IV. PWA Functionality

**Objective:** Verify Progressive Web App features like installability and offline caching.

**Testing Environment:** Chrome on Desktop and Android. Firefox on Android. Safari on iOS (limited PWA support).

**Instructions:**
- Use Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools for PWA audit.
- Test on a mobile device for install prompts and offline behavior.
- Clear site data/cache before testing offline functionality.

| Test ID | Feature                 | Aspect to Test                                                                | Expected Result                                                                                                                                                                 | Status (Pass/Fail) | Notes                                                                             |
|---------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **PWA-1** | **Manifest**            | Web App Manifest (`manifest.json`) is correctly linked and parsable.          | Browser DevTools (Application > Manifest) shows correct manifest properties (name, short_name, icons, start_url, display, theme_color, background_color). Lighthouse PWA check passes. |                    |                                                                                   |
| **PWA-2** | **Service Worker**      | Service worker (`sw.js`) is registered and activated.                         | Browser DevTools (Application > Service Workers) shows `sw.js` activated and running. Console logs from `sw.js` appear.                                                           |                    |                                                                                   |
| **PWA-3** | **Installability**      | Browser shows an install prompt (e.g., "Add to Home Screen").                 | Install prompt appears on supported browsers/platforms after interacting with the site a bit. App can be installed.                                                               |                    | Criteria for prompt: HTTPS, manifest, SW with fetch handler.                        |
| **PWA-4** | **Offline Caching**     | Core assets (HTML, CSS, JS, key images, icons) are cached by service worker.  | After first visit, disconnect network. Refresh page. Core page structure, styles, and essential content should load from cache.                                                    |                    | Check `urlsToCache` in `sw.js`.                                                   |
| **PWA-5** | **Offline Caching**     | Font Awesome CSS (CDN) is cached.                                             | Icons should still display when offline if CDN resource was successfully cached.                                                                                                |                    | This can be tricky due to opaque responses if not CORS-enabled.                   |
| **PWA-6** | **Offline Experience**  | User gets a reasonable experience when offline (not just browser error page). | Cached pages load. Non-cached resources (e.g., dynamic project data if not cached) might not load, but the app shell remains.                                                     |                    |                                                                                   |
| **PWA-7** | **Cache Management**    | Old caches are deleted upon service worker activation.                        | If `CACHE_NAME` in `sw.js` is updated, new SW activates, and old caches are removed.                                                                                              |                    | Test by changing `CACHE_NAME`, re-registering SW, and checking caches in DevTools. |
| **PWA-8** | **Theme Color**         | Browser UI (e.g., address bar on mobile) uses `theme_color` from manifest.    | Mobile browser UI elements adapt to the specified `theme_color` (`#3A506B`).                                                                                                       |                    |                                                                                   |

|---------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **C-1**   | **Page Title & Meta**   | Accuracy and relevance of `<title>` and `<meta name="description">`.              | Title: "Julien Moulin - Portfolio Design & D√©veloppement". Meta description aligns with revised content.                                                                     |                    |                                                                      |
| **C-2**   | **Hero Section Text**     | Accuracy and clarity of `<h2>` and `<p class="subtitle">`.                       | Text matches revised content: "Product Designer & Frontend Developer", "UX/UI Design ¬∑ Conception d'Interface ¬∑ ...". No typos or grammatical errors.                          |                    |                                                                      |
| **C-3**   | **Contact Section Text**  | Accuracy and clarity of `<p>` subtitle.                                         | Subtitle matches: "Int√©ress√© par mon profil ou un projet ? Parlons-en !".                                                                                                    |                    |                                                                      |
| **C-4**   | **Hero Image**            | Image `assets/images/julien-moulin.webp` loads correctly. Fallback to `.jpg`.   | WebP image loads if supported. If not, JPEG loads. Image is clear. `loading="lazy"` works (check network tab, scroll to view). `alt` text is "Photo de Julien Moulin".          |                    | Test WebP support (e.g. Safari < 14 might need fallback).            |
| **C-5**   | **Project/Slider Images** | (If data is loaded) Images for projects and realisations load correctly.        | Images are clear, appropriately sized, and use WebP with fallbacks if implemented in JS loaders. `loading="lazy"` and `alt` text should be applied by JS.                     |                    | This depends on JS implementation and JSON data.                     |
| **C-6**   | **Theme Toggle**          | Clicking theme toggle button switches between light and dark themes.              | Theme changes instantly. Icon in button updates (sun/moon). Chosen theme persists across page loads/sessions (localStorage).                                                 |                    |                                                                      |
| **C-7**   | **Mobile Menu Toggle**    | Clicking hamburger icon opens/closes mobile navigation.                           | Menu functions as expected. `aria-expanded` attribute updates.                                                                                                               |                    |                                                                      |
| **C-8**   | **Scroll Spy**            | Active navigation link updates correctly based on scroll position.                | As user scrolls, the correct nav link in header gets `active` class and `aria-current="page"`. Smooth and accurate.                                                            |                    |                                                                      |
| **C-9**   | **Scroll Animations**     | Content sections animate into view on scroll.                                   | Animations are smooth and trigger appropriately when sections become visible.                                                                                                |                    |                                                                      |
| **C-10**  | **Links**                 | All navigation links, contact links (email, phone, LinkedIn), social media links. | Links point to correct destinations. External links open in new tab (e.g. LinkedIn, GitHub, X). Email link opens mail client. Phone link opens dialer on mobile.                 |                    |                                                                      |
| **C-11**  | **Console Errors**        | No JavaScript errors in browser console during navigation or interaction.         | Console is clean of errors (ignore expected logs like "[UXUI] Script loaded").                                                                                                |                    | Open dev tools and monitor console.                                    |

**Testing Environment:** Latest stable versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari (macOS/iOS), and Edge.

**Instructions:**
- Perform a subset of tests from sections I, II, III, and V on each browser.
- Focus on features that commonly have cross-browser issues (CSS Flexbox/Grid, CSS custom properties, newer JavaScript APIs, animations, PWA features).

| Test ID | Browser         | Feature Category Tested                                          | Expected Result                                                                 | Status (Pass/Fail) | Notes                                                                                                |
|---------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **XB-1**  | **Firefox**     | Visuals (Palette, Typography), Responsiveness, Core Interactivity (Menu, Theme Toggle, Scroll Spy, Animations), PWA (SW registration, basic offline) | Site functions and looks consistent with Chrome.                                  |                    | Firefox has good PWA support on Android.                                                             |
| **XB-2**  | **Safari (macOS)** | Visuals, Responsiveness, Core Interactivity. PWA (SW, manifest link, theme-color). | Site functions and looks consistent. WebP image fallback works if needed.         |                    | Safari has improved PWA support but may differ from Chrome. Check `IntersectionObserver` animations. |
| **XB-3**  | **Safari (iOS)**  | Visuals, Responsiveness (especially touch), Core Interactivity. PWA (Add to Home Screen, offline). | Site is usable, touch interactions are smooth. Basic PWA features work as expected on iOS. |                    | iOS "Add to Home Screen" behavior is different.                                                      |
| **XB-4**  | **Edge**        | Visuals, Responsiveness, Core Interactivity, PWA.                  | Site functions and looks consistent with Chrome (as Edge is Chromium-based).      |                    |                                                                                                      |
| **XB-5**  | **All Browsers**| CSS Custom Properties (Variables)                                  | Theme colors and other variable-dependent styles work correctly.                |                    |                                                                                                      |
| **XB-6**  | **All Browsers**| Flexbox and Grid Layouts                                           | Header, project columns, footer, etc., maintain correct layout.                 |                    |                                                                                                      |
| **XB-7**  | **All Browsers**| Font Rendering                                                     | 'Inter' font loads and renders clearly. Fallback fonts work if 'Inter' fails.   |                    |                                                                                                      |
